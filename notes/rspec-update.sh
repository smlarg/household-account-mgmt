# is okay

# I seem to have stopped keeping track in this doc, after "Run transpec again and update" in the git
# So look at the git for info after that

# Okay now I've been writing in bundle updates, but those caused code changes, so I should put those here too?
# First, cumcumber now sees "Log in" instead of "Sign in"; that was fixable
# Now, it doesn't seem a "monthly_reports" view in the database...which is true, there isn't one in test.
# Not clear why this is true, or why it's a problem only now

# Ah ha! A clue. The view *does* exist if I drop and recreate the table
dropdb foodlobby_test
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:setup
# and then
bundle exec rspec
# AND
bundle exec cumcumber
# passes. but if I run 
bundle exec rake
# monthly_reports gets dropped sometime between rspec and cucumber
bundle exec rake cumcumber
# also drops the view; so I guess it's something about how rake runs cucumber?
# just going with it for now
