--- I forget when in the process I did these above ---

--- After "Passes all tests." in git ---:

  gem 'rails', '~>4.0'
bundle update rails

# there's an error with the routing, fixed with
bundle update devise

# almost all cucumber tests are failing, and this
bundle update cucumber-rails
# did update cucumber (and capybara), but did not fix anything
# looking more closely, they seem to all fail before signing in, so this may be a devise issue as well?
# ...it's that the button appears as "Log in" to cucumber (but as "Sign in" when I go there in the browser)
# (Oh no, I just had to restart the server; it's "Log in" now in the browser too. Helpful.)

# change factory_girl_rails to factory_bot_rails, which requires
bundle install

# git commit -m FactoryBot
# no bundle updates for Ruby 2.3.8
# git commit -m Ruby 2.3.8
